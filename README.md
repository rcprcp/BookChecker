Android app to collect information on your personal library by scanning ISBN barcodes and accessing Google Books data.

Requires a barcode scanner app such as ZXing.  Prototype.  Needs much work.  

TODO:
* fix HTML parsing - maybe something like JSoup?
* add the multi-library support.
* Add a summary page when using multiple libraries?
